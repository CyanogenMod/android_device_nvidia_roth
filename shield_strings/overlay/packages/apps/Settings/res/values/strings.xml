    You can encrypt your accounts, settings, downloaded apps and their data,
    media, and other files. Once you encrypt SHIELD, you need to type a numeric PIN
    or password to decrypt it each time you power it on. You can\'t decrypt SHIELD
    except by performing a factory data reset, erasing all your data.\n\nEncryption takes
    an hour or more. You must start with a charged battery and keep SHIELD plugged in
    until encryption is complete. If you interrupt the encryption process, you will lose
    some or all of your data.</string>

      To resume using SHIELD, you need to perform a factory reset.
      When you set up SHIELD after the reset, you\'ll have an opportunity
      to restore any data that was backed up to your Google Account.
